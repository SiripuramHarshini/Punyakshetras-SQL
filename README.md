🛕 Punyakshetra SQL: Unveiling India's Sacred Temples Through Data

📖 Description

**Punyakshetra SQL** is a beginner-friendly SQL project that I personally designed to improve my SQL skills while celebrating India’s incredible spiritual heritage. 🛕

The project contains a single-table dataset with details of 40 famous temples across India — including their names, locations, states, deities, descriptions, and who built them. It’s a blend of learning and cultural exploration.

Though this was created for my personal growth, I’ve shared it openly so that others starting out in SQL can also use this dataset to practice querying, filtering, and data analysis. Whether you're learning SQL or curious about Indian culture, this project is for you!
